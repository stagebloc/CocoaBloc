	"description": "<p>All Hail Discordia! In the mid to late nineties Canada was experiencing an indie rock renaissance. Before the internet drew the international focus northward to the likes of Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene a handful of Canadian bands were building an exciting sound, something altogether unique from the rest of the world. They were creating new labels, new zines, touring coast to coast inspiring hundreds of Canadian kids to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>At the epicenter of this churning bubble was By Divine Right. Centered around the psychedelic song writing of Jose Contreras, By Divine Right&#39;s line-up was ever evolving. Ranging between tight pop perfection and all-out noise hysteria, the line up bolstered the talent of some later year musical crusaders such as Broken Social Scene&#39;s Brendan Canning and Feist, members of The Meligrove Band, and Holy Fuck&#39;s Brian Borcherdt.</p>\r\n",
