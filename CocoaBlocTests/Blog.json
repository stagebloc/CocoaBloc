Both shows sold out within minutes of going on sale, including Church\u2019s re-release of hundreds of tickets purchased by scalpers and then cancelled by Church to get more tickets to true fans instead. With the show quickly approaching, Church has invited two of today\u2019s most critically acclaimed rising female artists to join him for the two sold-out shows. Maren Morris will open on Tuesday, Aug. 9 and Cam will open on Wednesday, Aug. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe performances offer fans one of the few chances this year to see the multiple CMA and ACM Award winner in concert. Church has mostly laid low since The Outsiders World Tour\u2019s two-year run concluded and the surprise release of new album Mr. Misunderstood last November. With an album\u2019s worth of new music to debut you can bet every single show will be special.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDoors open at 7 p.m. with music beginning at 8 p.m. each night.
